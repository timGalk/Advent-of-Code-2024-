Based on un-scorched scraps of the book, you determine that a good hiking trail is as long as possible and has an even, 
gradual, uphill slope. For all practical purposes, this means that a hiking trail is any path that starts at height 0, 
ends at height 9, and always increases by a height of exactly 1 at each step. 
Hiking trails never include diagonal steps - only up, down, left, or right (from the perspective of the map).

You look up from the map and notice that the reindeer has helpfully begun to construct a small pile of pencils, markers,
rulers, compasses, stickers, and other equipment you might need to update the map with hiking trails.

A trailhead is any position that starts one or more hiking trails - here, these positions will always have height 0. 
Assembling more fragments of pages, you establish that a trailhead's score is the number of 9-height positions 
reachable from that trailhead via a hiking trail. In the above example, the single trailhead in the top left corner
has a score of 1 because it can reach a single 9 (the one in the bottom left).
